# Chemical-Warfare-Decontamination
Worked with Prof. Chris Breward, Prof. Ian Griffiths and Ellen Luckins on the numerical implementation of mathematical models for the decontamination of chemical warfare attacks. Code was developed via the FEnCS Project in Python and focused on finite element and finite difference solvers for partial differential equations (PDEs).
